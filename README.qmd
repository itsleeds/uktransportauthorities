  # Legend outside
  tm_facets(free.scales = FALSE) +
  tm_legend(show = FALSE)

# With ggplot2, first pivot_longer the data
atf_long = atf_joined |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("atf"), names_to = "year", values_to = "funding") |>
  # Combined atfe and atf20_21
  mutate(year = case_when(

    TRUE ~ year
    )) |>
  group_by(name, year) |>
  summarise(funding = sum(funding, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup()

    labs(title = "Active Travel Fund Allocations by Year", fill = "Funding (£)") +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    theme_void()
